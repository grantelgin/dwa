<h2>Bureaucracy</h2>

<p>Everyone living in the US has their share of bureaucratic red tape they must be in compliance with. Every year, we have to fill out forms, pay fees, and comply with laws set at the neighborhood level, the federal level and everywhere in between. The more you try to do, the more rules you have to follow. <br>It shouldn't be this overwhelming. <br>By answering a few questions, Bureaucracy helps you organize what is due and when it is due.</p>

<p>Figuring out which organizations you have to be in compliance with requires answering only a few questions for most people. Where you live, where you work, and how you get there will determine most of it. </p>

<p>After answering a few simple questions, the user will get a list of their compliance item obligations. The initial results will not have due dates. The user can decide to 'add reminders' for each compliance item and enter their due dates.</p>

<h2>Project 4 Scope</h2>
<p>As a proof of concept, I'll use the php framework from class and build views to collect information on the 5 areas shown in my mockups. I will pre-load the database with correct data for Cambridge, MA. Any other city will not return a list of compliance items. If a user owns a home in Cambridge, MA and owns a car, they will see compliance items required by IRS, Commonwealth of MA, MA RMV, City of Cambridge & Cambridge parking.</p>
<h2>Resources and examples</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.mint.com">mint.com's</a> 'Ways to Save' is a good example of a simple process where users fill out a few questions and get customized results.</p>
