<h2>In tune bookmarklet</h2>

<p>Guitars can get out of tune easily and it's important to have a tuner near by. The In tune bookmarklet will be a Javascript based app the user can launch from their bookmark bar. The tuner will open in a small window over what ever web page the user is currently on and will not take them away from their current page. This is useful if you are trying to learn a song on youtube or reading tablature, you can stay on that page and tune your guitar at the same time.</p>
